The Symbolic Governor acts as the "System 2" component of the agent. It is the root of trust. Unlike the LLM, the Governor is implemented in deterministic code (e.g., Python, Rust) and is formally verifiable. It is responsible for the high-level orchestration of the agent's workflow and the strict enforcement of the Agent Constitution.   

The Governor implements a Scheduler Interception mechanism. In a standard loop, the LLM generates a tool call and the runtime executes it immediately. In ArbiterOS, the LLM emits an intent to call a tool. The Governor intercepts this intent, suspends the Probabilistic CPU, and evaluates the intent against the active Policy Engine. Only if the intent satisfies all constraints (e.g., Resource Limits, Taint Checks, ACLs) does the Governor execute the tool. This "Reference Monitor" pattern  ensures that the agent's cognitive instability cannot propagate to the external world.
