          "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that the impact of relational knowledge is more widespread than dual-system models imply. More specifically, I review evidence suggesting that also Pavlovian conditioning, implicit evaluation, and habitual responding are mediated by relational knowledge. Considering the idea that relational knowledge underlies also fast, unintentional, unconscious, and seemingly associative psychological phenomena is not only theoretically important but also reveals new opportunities for influencing thinking and behavior.... For instance, Kahneman (2011) distinguishes between System 1 and System 2 thinking not only on the basis of speed (fast vs. slow) but also in terms of intentionality (unintentional vs. intentional), consciousness (unconscious vs. conscious), and the nature of processing (associative vs. propositional). This implies that all fast thinking is also unintentional, unconscious, and associative whereas all slow thinking is also intentional, conscious, and propositional.... Most relevant for the present paper, dual-system models foster the idea that relational knowledge is important only for System 2-type thinking (i.e., thinking that is slow, intentional, conscious, and propositional).... Indeed, the conclusion that relational knowledge is relevant for System 2 but not System 1 follows naturally from the assumptions that (1) there are two cognitive systems with multiple opposing properties (i.e., the dual-system alignment assumption), (2) higher order cognition such as reasoning, language, and planning are instances of System 2 thinking (e.g., Kahneman, 2011), and (3) higher order cognition relies on relational knowledge.... automatic and seemingly irrational ways of thinking and behaving can result in new\nways of tackling psychological problems.\n\n## Evidence for a Widespread Impact of Relational Knowledge... Second, research revealed that instructions can influence implicit evaluations even in the absence of changes in explicit evaluations (Van Dessel, De Houwer, Gast, Smith, & De Schryver, 2016). Third, to the extent that instructions provide diagnostic and credible information, they can alter even long-standing, deeply rooted implicit evaluations.... This pattern of results could reflect the joint impact of propositions and associations on implicit evaluations but it could also reflect the joint impact of multiple propositions on implicit evaluations, some based on pairings (e.g., \u201cthis person co-occurred with positive traits\u201d) and some based on relational information (e.g., \u201cthis person is good because he was paired with negative traits\u201d; De Houwer, 2018b; Moran et al., 2016).",
