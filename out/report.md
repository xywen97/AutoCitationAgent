## Claims

### S0

- sentence: The Symbolic Governor acts as the "System 2" component of the agent.
- claim_type: definition
- rationale: The term 'Symbolic Governor' and its role as 'System 2' need citation to support the claim.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No candidates met thresholds. Provide manual review.
- queries: Symbolic Governor in AI systems, System 2 component in agent-based systems, formal verification of deterministic programming with Symbolic Governor, trust in AI through Symbolic Governor mechanisms, root of trust in AI systems using Symbolic Governor

### S1

- sentence: It is the root of trust.
- claim_type: definition
- rationale: The phrase 'root of trust' is a specific term that requires citation to establish its definition and context.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).

### S2

- sentence: Unlike the LLM, the Governor is implemented in deterministic code (e.
- claim_type: method_description
- rationale: The statement makes a factual claim about the implementation of the Governor in deterministic code, which requires citation.
