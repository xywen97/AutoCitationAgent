## Claims

### S0

- sentence: The Symbolic Governor acts as the "System 2" component of the agent.
- claim_type: definition
- rationale: Equates the Symbolic Governor to a specific cognitive-oversight role ("System 2"), which is a conceptual framing that should be supported by a citation or clearly established definition in prior work.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
- queries: "reference monitor" LLM agent tool use governance policy enforcement point, "security kernel" "trusted computing base" deterministic enforcement "tool invocation" agent, "runtime monitor" mediation scheduler interception probabilistic component policy engine, "complete mediation" capability-based security ACL "tool invocation" autonomous agent, "information-flow control" taint tracking sandboxing "tool use" policy enforcement LLM agent
- selected papers:

### S3

- sentence: g., Python, Rust) and is formally verifiable.
- claim_type: method_description
- rationale: Asserts an implementation detail (written in specific languages) and a strong property (formally verifiable); both require support unless presented purely as a proposal/plan.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
- queries: "reference monitor" LLM agent tool use governance "complete mediation", "security kernel" "trusted computing base" (LLM OR "language model") agent runtime monitor, "policy enforcement point" PEP PDP tool invocation mediation autonomous agent runtime, "information-flow control" taint tracking "tool use" agent "runtime monitor", "formal verification" (reference monitor OR security kernel OR policy engine) enforcement code, "capability-based security" ACL quotas sandboxing "tool invocation" agent
- selected papers:

### S7

- sentence: In ArbiterOS, the LLM emits an intent to call a tool.
- claim_type: prior_work
- rationale: States a specific behavior/architecture of a named system (ArbiterOS); this is a factual claim about prior work that should be supported by a source.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
- queries: "ArbiterOS" LLM intent tool call, "intent" "tool" invocation mediation "reference monitor" LLM agent, "tool use" governance "policy enforcement point" PEP "policy decision point" PDP LLM agent, "security kernel" "complete mediation" runtime monitor agent tool invocation, "deterministic enforcement" "formally verified" reference monitor policy engine capability-based
- selected papers:

### S11

- sentence: This "Reference Monitor" pattern  ensures that the agent's cognitive instability cannot propagate to the external world.
- claim_type: background_fact
- rationale: Asserts a concrete safety property/effect of the reference monitor pattern (preventing agent instability from affecting the external world), which is a nontrivial factual/security claim that should be supported by prior literature on reference monitors/complete mediation.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
