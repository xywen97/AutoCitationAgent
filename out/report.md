## Claims

### S0

- sentence: The Symbolic Governor acts as the "System 2" component of the agent.
- claim_type: definition
- rationale: The role of the Symbolic Governor as the 'System 2' component is a specific conceptual claim that requires citation.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
- queries: Symbolic Governor in agent systems, System 2 component in AI agents, formal verification of deterministic programming in AI, trust in AI systems with Symbolic Governor, LLM and deterministic code in agent systems
- selected papers:

### S1

- sentence: It is the root of trust.
- claim_type: definition
- rationale: The phrase 'It is the root of trust' makes a claim about trust without providing a source or context, necessitating citation.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No candidates met thresholds. Provide manual review.
- queries: Symbolic Governor in agent systems for formal verification, Trust in AI systems through deterministic programming, Formal verification methods for Symbolic Governor applications, Impact of deterministic code on trust in AI systems, System 2 approaches in AI with Symbolic Governor
- selected papers:
  - Specification and Verification of Multi-Agent Systems (None) DOI=10.1007/978-3-642-31485-8_6 score=0.33499999999999996

### S2

- sentence: Unlike the LLM, the Governor is implemented in deterministic code (e.
- claim_type: comparison
- rationale: The statement compares the implementation of the Governor and LLM, which requires citation to support the claim about deterministic code.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No reliable BibTeX (missing DOI).
- queries: Symbolic Governor in agent systems, formal verification of deterministic programming, trust in AI systems with Symbolic Governor, LLM vs Symbolic Governor in deterministic code, formal methods for Symbolic Governor implementation
- selected papers:

### S3

- sentence: g., Python, Rust) and is formally verifiable.
- claim_type: prior_work
- rationale: The statement refers to formal verifiability, which is a factual claim that typically requires citation.
- status: NEED_MANUAL
- notes: No candidates met thresholds. Provide manual review.
